<p>week 3 journal 10/08/22</p>
<p> This week as a very eventful week because I got Covid-19. This was my 
first experience with the disease and it affected my presence in this class
on Friday. On Wednesday I was able to learn how to push thins from cloud 9 to 
my website. This was very helpful becuase I was didnt really get how to do it. 
I also designed my own rube goldberg machine, i did this on paper and then
brought it to tinkercad, a 3d bluprint website. Tinkercad helps you dessign things
three dimensionally.</p>
