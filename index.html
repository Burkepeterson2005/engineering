<p> week 2 journal</p>
<p> This week i learned that this class wont only be
computer stuff but i will be woking in a shop like woodshop but  
wood and metal. I also learned how to kind of use tinkercad, a website
that alows you to create things in 3d.</p>
<p>week 3 journal 10/08/22</p>
<p> This week as a very eventful week because I got Covid-19. This was my 
first experience with the disease and it affected my presence in this class
on Friday. On Wednesday I was able to learn how to push thins from cloud 9 to 
my website. This was very helpful becuase I was didnt really get how to do it. 
I also designed my own rube goldberg machine, i did this on paper and then
brought it to tinkercad, a 3d bluprint website. Tinkercad helps you dessign things
three dimensionally.</p>
<p>Week 4 journal 10/16/22 </p>
<p>This week I designed an E on tinkercad because i was still stuck in 
my house because of Covid but I was able to return the following day on tuesday
On Wednesday I worked on our rube goldberg machines and even though i was out, 
I got a lot of work done. I cut out most of the pieces for our project with a knife and
taped them together. We used up most of our time but we almost finished. On Friday,
we did a challenge where we tried to make a paper boat to see how long it could 
last in water with a certain amount of weight. Sadly the boat I made instantly sank.
I was a bit sad and dissapointed because I thought it would have held a bit longer than
right away.</p>
<p> week 5 journal</p>
<p> This week we worked on and tested our rube goldberg machines. Our design 
didnt really work the first couple of attempts to pop the balloon with our machine
first we saw the slope of the ramp wasnt steep enough and the needle would go in the space 
between the baloon and the ramp. The car would also spin out of control so we 
put a wall on both sides to guide the car to the balloon. But even that wasn't 
enough, so in the end we just bent the needle up bit and sure enough it worked! </p>
